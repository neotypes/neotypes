**Scala lightweight, type-safe, asynchronous driver (not opinionated on side-effect implementation) for neo4j**.

* **Scala** - the driver provides you with support for all standard Scala types without the need to convert Scala <-> Java types back and forth and you can easily add your types.
* **Lightweight** - the driver depends on `shapeless` and `neo4j Java driver`
* **Type-safe** - the driver leverages [typeclasses](https://blog.scalac.io/2017/04/19/typeclasses-in-scala.html) to derive all needed conversions at the compile time.
* **Asynchronous** - the driver sits on top of [asynchronous Java driver](https://neo4j.com/blog/beta-release-java-driver-async-api-neo4j/).
* **Not opinionated on side-effect implementation** - you can use it with any implementation of side-effects of your chose (scala.Future, cats-effect
 IO, Monix Task, etc) by implementing a simple typeclass. `scala.Future` is implemented and comes out of the box.

The project aims to provide seamless integration with most popular scala infrastructures such as lightbend (Akka, Akka-http, Lagom, etc), typelevel (cats, http4s, etc), twitter (finch, etc)...
